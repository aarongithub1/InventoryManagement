# Inventory Management System

##### Swole Foods
These fine food retailers (don't you dare call them grocers) repackage purportedly organic produce and sell it at 200% markup. Products include everything from honey scented foot cream to locally sourced grass fed kobe beef.

### Requirement Description
*The following requirement was provided by the company representative*  

>"We need a public facing website for our company. It needs to incorporate a modern, simplistic, sleek and user friendly design that has information about our company and employees. We would like it to have pictures of our staff as well as display a brief bio about them. The site should also have some way of getting in touch with us and our contact information (including a map or directions to our physical location).  
>  
>We also want a webstore. The store should display available items to all of our traffic. It's crucial that anyone be able to view our items and add things to their cart. For a user to checkout they need to create an account, or login to an existing one. We will need their physical shipping address (as well as billing if it is different), name, email (their email is their username) and password for each user. Cookies should store the cart items of users who haven't logged in (until they login), and we want to persist our registered users carts in our database. If a user goes to checkout, it should create an order record with that item.
>
>Ideally the application would also include inventory management. Our employees need our app to keep track of and manage our inventory. We also need a way to add new items to inventory, refresh our stock (i.e. add to the existing quantity of items), and change an item's availability (can it be viewed on the web store or not). Items that are out of stock should either indicate that they are out of stock, or not be presented in our website's store."
